findall:    It finds all searches for matches and prints resultant in the form of a list.

search:     It works the same as a findall, but the resultant is a matched object if any is found.

split:      The split function splits the string from every matched into two new strings.

sub:        The sub-function works exactly like a replace function in notepad or MS Word. 
            It replaces the original word with a word of our choice.

finditer:   The finditer yields an iterator as a resultant with all the objects that match the one 
            we sent it) finditer supports more attributes than any other function defined above. 
            It also provides more details related to the matched object. So, most
            of the examples we are going to see next will contain a finditer function in them.
